# Fix GitHub Action Issues

## Understanding the Task

The repository has been pushed to GitHub but the GitHub Action is not working. Need to:
- Identify why the action cannot be used
- Fix any configuration issues
- Ensure all required files and secrets are in place
- Verify the action can be triggered and run successfully

## Possible Questions & Considerations

1. **What error message appears when trying to use the action?**
   - Workflow syntax errors?
   - Action not found errors?
   - Runtime errors during execution?

2. **Is the action properly configured?**
   - Are all required files (action.yml, Dockerfile, src/) present?
   - Is the Docker image building correctly?
   - Are environment variables properly configured?

3. **Are GitHub secrets configured?**
   - Is BROWSER_USE_API_KEY set up in repository secrets?
   - Does the workflow have permission to access secrets?

4. **What's the intended use case?**
   - Running from the same repository (uses: ./)
   - Running from another repository (uses: user/repo@version)
   - Both scenarios?

5. **Are there any merge conflicts or uncommitted changes?**
   - README.md has merge conflict markers
   - May have other uncommitted files

## Edge Cases

- Action works locally but fails in GitHub Actions
- Dockerfile builds locally but fails in GitHub's environment
- Tests pass locally but timeout in GitHub Actions
- API key works locally but not in GitHub Actions
- Repository is private vs public (affects action accessibility)

## Checklist Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Repository Issues
- [x] Identify merge conflict in README.md
- [x] Resolve merge conflict in README.md
- [x] Verify all required files are present and committed
- [x] Check git status for uncommitted changes
- [ ] Push clean state to GitHub

### Phase 2: Verify Action Configuration
- [x] Review action.yml syntax and structure
- [x] Verify Dockerfile is properly configured
- [x] Check that src/run_tests.py exists and is executable
- [x] Ensure requirements.txt has all dependencies
- [x] Validate example workflow syntax

### Phase 3: GitHub Configuration
- [ ] Verify repository has Actions enabled (user needs to check on GitHub)
- [ ] Check if BROWSER_USE_API_KEY secret is configured (user needs to add)
- [ ] Verify workflow permissions (Settings > Actions > General)
- [ ] Check if repository is public (or configure for private repos)

### Phase 4: Test the Action
- [x] Workflow already exists (.github/workflows/example-browser-tests.yml)
- [x] Example test cases exist in tests/examples/
- [ ] Commit changes (README.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, plan)
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Trigger the workflow manually or via push
- [ ] Review workflow run logs for errors
- [ ] Fix any runtime errors based on logs

### Phase 5: Documentation & Final Verification
- [x] README updated with correct usage instructions
- [x] Created comprehensive TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
- [ ] Test action reference from same repository (uses: ./)
- [ ] Create release tag for external usage (git tag v1)
- [ ] Document how to use from other repositories (uses: user/repo@v1)
- [x] Verify all example workflows are correct

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Merge Conflict in README.md
**Problem**: README has git conflict markers
**Solution**: Resolve conflict by keeping the complete version after merge markers

### Issue 2: Action Not Found
**Problem**: GitHub can't find the action
**Solution**: 
- Ensure action.yml is at repository root
- Use correct reference format (./  or user/repo@ref)
- For cross-repo usage, create a release/tag

### Issue 3: Docker Build Fails
**Problem**: Dockerfile fails to build in GitHub Actions
**Solution**:
- Test Docker build locally: `docker build -t test .`
- Check all COPY paths are correct
- Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt are available
- Use specific package versions to avoid conflicts

### Issue 4: API Key Not Working
**Problem**: Tests fail with authentication errors
**Solution**:
- Verify secret name matches exactly (BROWSER_USE_API_KEY)
- Check secret is set in correct location (repo secrets, not env secrets)
- Ensure workflow has permission to read secrets

### Issue 5: Tests Timeout
**Problem**: Tests take too long and timeout
**Solution**:
- Increase timeout value in workflow
- Optimize test cases to be more specific
- Check if Browser Use API is responding

## Implementation Notes

1. ✅ **README fixed** - Merge conflicts resolved
2. ✅ **Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Comprehensive guide for all common issues
3. **Next: Push changes** - Commit and push all changes to GitHub
4. **Then: Configure secrets** - Add BROWSER_USE_API_KEY in GitHub repo settings
5. **Finally: Test the action** - Trigger workflow and review logs

## What User Needs to Do Next

1. **Review and commit changes**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md TROUBLESHOOTING.md .zed/plans/fix-github-action.md
   git commit -m "Fix merge conflict and add troubleshooting guide"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secret**:
   - Go to https://github.com/aevsai/monkey-test/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your API key from https://cloud.browser-use.com
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Enable GitHub Actions** (if not already enabled):
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Under "Actions permissions", select "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Test the action**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click "Example Browser Tests" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select branch: main
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Wait for results and check logs

5. **If action fails**, check:
   - The specific error message in workflow logs
   - Refer to TROUBLESHOOTING.md for solutions
   - Most likely issue: Missing or incorrect BROWSER_USE_API_KEY secret

6. **Optional: Create a release tag** (for using from other repos):
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1 -m "Release version 1"
   git push origin v1
   ```

## Success Criteria

- [x] No merge conflicts or git errors
- [ ] All required files committed and pushed
- [ ] BROWSER_USE_API_KEY secret configured in GitHub
- [ ] Workflow runs successfully in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Tests execute and produce results
- [ ] Artifacts are uploaded correctly
- [x] Documentation is accurate and complete

# Fix Browser Use SDK Implementation

## Understanding the task:
The code needs to be updated to use the correct Browser Use SDK API based on the provided example. The main issues are:
- Wrong import module name (`browser_use` instead of `browser_use_sdk`)
- Wrong client class name (`BrowserUseClient` instead of `BrowserUse`)
- Wrong method naming convention (camelCase `createTask` instead of snake_case `create_task`)

## Edge cases and considerations:
- Ensure the change doesn't break other parts of the code that reference the client
- Verify all method calls use snake_case convention consistently
- Check if there are other SDK methods being called that might need renaming

## Checklist:
- [x] Update import statement from `browser_use` to `browser_use_sdk`
- [x] Change class name from `BrowserUseClient` to `BrowserUse`
- [x] Change method `createTask` to `create_task` (snake_case)
- [x] Verify no other references to old class name exist
- [x] Check if other SDK methods need naming updates

## Implementation notes:
- Line 13: Change import statement
- Line 64: Update client initialization
- Line 159: Change createTask to create_task
